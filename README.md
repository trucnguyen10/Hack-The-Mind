Inspiration
We know Mental Health is important because mental health is human experience. ASRM helped us to release stress when we have depression, so we thought it would be great to share the method we use to deal with stress with others while enhancing programming skills. We hope this small project can contribute to bettering the community's mental health.

What it does
A website helps people create and customize their own favorites based on provided data of ASMR that we collected on the internet. Users can choose the sounds they like and we will add all of these to a list of ASMR so that users can listen to all their choices afterward. We believe that soundtrack will help people better their mental health.

How we built it
HTML5, CSS3, bootstrap, and JavaScript are programming languages that we use to build our website.

Challenges we ran into
JavaScript was the most difficult part since our team is not familiar with the BackEnd section. We spent hours figuring out how we can use the JS function to combine the sounds that the user has chosen. Additionally, because this is our first Hackathon so we don't have experience in handling problems and pressure that we faced in around 2 days.

Accomplishments that we're proud
We used the combination of HTML and CSS effectively to beautify our website. We are so happy to see that we can learn a lot from this Hackathon, not only technical skills but also how to work in a team, how to communicate and manage our time to finish the project on time.

What we learned
We learned how to build a login and registration page, the navbar on the home page and the create sounds page, and add and delete functions in javascript to adjust the list of ASMR sounds. Last but not least, we also learned how to build an auto-changing background website.

What's next for MusicHeal
Next, the MusicHeal will be added more functions such as a user profile to keep track of improvements. Now, we are thinking about utilizing the searching bar, and adding more data to the web so that users can have more choices. In addition, we will learn more to better our website before moving to another project.
